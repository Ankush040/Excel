Project Title: Fitbit Data Analysis 

Description: As a member of the Analytic team at WeFit, I played a pivotal role in analyzing Fitbit fitness tracker data to deliver valuable marketing and business solutions for our company and its subsidiaries. Here's a brief overview of my contributions to the project:

•	LeanFit Marketing Solutions: I identified potential customers for LeanFit, a subsidiary of WeFit specializing in personalized diet plans for weight loss. Leveraging Fitbit data, I pinpointed individuals with BMI in the overweight and obesity range, high heart rates, and active lifestyles—potential customers interested in weight loss plans.

•	FitWear Customer Targeting: For FitWear, another WeFit subsidiary offering fitness gear, I used Fitbit data to identify potential customers. By analyzing users who exhibited a consistent fitness routine (wearing gear for over 20 days and recording active minutes), I identified potential buyers of fitness-related products.

•	Sleepy-Nights Subscriber Expansion: In collaboration with Sleepy-Nights, a WeFit subsidiary focusing on sleep improvement, I worked on increasing app subscriptions. By analyzing sleep patterns and irregularities in Fitbit data, I targeted individuals struggling with sleep deprivation and erratic sleep schedules.

•	Creating Management Dashboard: To provide WeFit's management team with actionable insights, I designed a management dashboard using daily activity data. This included tracking user engagement, activity levels, mean distance traveled, steps, calories burned, and active minutes. Additionally, I analyzed data with respect to distinct dates, allowing for a deeper understanding of user behavior trends.

This project enabled WeFit to make data-driven decisions, enhance marketing strategies, and expand its client base. It's a testament to the power of data analytics in the fitness industry and our commitment to improving the lives of our customers.
